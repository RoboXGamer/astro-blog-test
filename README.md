## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
    â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
            â”œâ”€â”€ modpacks/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
    â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/images` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                    | Action                                           |
